/* JAKE E 9/06/2021
*Write a program that uses scanf to get a number from a user 
and prints "Don't be so negative!" if they entered a negative number.
If the number is positive, the program should print 
"You have entered a positive number."
If the user enters the number 0, the program should print 
"You have entered zero."
Note: you can assume that the number will always be a whole number 
(i.e. an integer)
