11.How do you make a peanut-butter sandwich?



How could you break that process into steps?

How could you break it down clearly enough that a computer could understand it?

**GET peanutbutter
GET bread
GET knife
WHILE bread IS NOT COVERED:
    ADD peanutbutter TO knife
    USE knife ON _bread_**

Maybe your tutor could do a live demonstration of a similar task following your exact instructions...
# Operating Systems

12.What is an operating system?

What operating systems do your classmates run? The tute room? The CSE lab (and VLAB) computers?

**CSE LAB is run with a linux based operating system XFCE4**

What are the differences between each of the various operating systems? What differences are there in their interfaces, and how do you interact with them?

What are some different ways in which you can interact with a computer?
**-MOUSE
-KEYBOARD
-TOUCH
-CAMERA
**
What are the differences between graphical user interfaces and the command line? When might one be better than the other?

# Writing Some Code

Discuss the following features of the sample program from lectures:
```
// Basic Hello World program
// Marc Chee, September 2020

#include <stdio.h>

int main (void) {
    printf("Hello World\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```
* the \n
**starts a new line with the new line character**
* Comments: What should go in a comment? What makes a good comment? How do comments improve program style?
**comments provide information about a line and allow easy maintainability in case the coder doesn't immediately understand the program's function**
* Indenting and whitespace: What is indented in the sample program? Suggest why. 
**printf and return are indented as they are subcomponents of the main function and this indicates the order of the process and how it will run**

14.Write a C program, face0.c, that behaves as follows:

```
./face0
~ ~
0 0
 o
 -
```

Open Terminal, change to desired directory
```
z5165158@vx7:/tmp_amd/ravel/export/ravel/3/z5165158/Desktop/COMP1511/week1$ gedit face0.c
```

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void) {
    printf("~ ~\n0 0\n o\n -");
    
    return 0;
}
```
Save as face0.c 
# ! IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE '.c' on end of file name !

Compile
```
z5165158@vx7:/tmp_amd/ravel/export/ravel/3/z5165158/Desktop/COMP1511/week1$ dcc face0.c -o face0
```

To run
```
z5165158@vx7:/tmp_amd/ravel/export/ravel/3/z5165158/Desktop/COMP1511/week1$ ./face0
~ ~
0 0
 o

```

15. How would you compile this program?
16. How could we modify it to make a program, face1.c, look like this instead?
```
./face1
~ ~
0 0
 o
\_/
```
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void) {
    printf("~ ~\n0 0\n o\n\\_/\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```
