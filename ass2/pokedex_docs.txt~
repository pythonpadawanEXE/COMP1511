   SAVING AND LOADING POKEDEX CHANGES SUMMARY
-------------------------------------------------
The savepokedex function was implemented by mallocing a string given my the 
number of lines multipled by the maximum size of each line. The save string 
function was used to write this string to a directory with a specified filename
onto the non-volatile memory. This string was then freed.

The load function was implemented whereby the load string function returned a 
pointer to a string which was read from a file stream pointer, pointing to a 
'.txt' file in the non-volatile memory. This string was then processed line by 
line by considering the newline character, a modified version of the do_add
function called add_line was used to process each line and add each pokemon into
a new mallocced pokedex.

Write two tests to test your implementation of Extension 1 (Saving & Loading).

   GETTING SUB_LISTS CHANGES SUMMARY
-------------------------------------------------
Pokedex struct changed to include previous and next pokedex pointers.

Get pokemon of typefunction create new pokedex with previous poke and next 
pokedex pointers and add pokemon to the lists if found and of same type as 
original or nested pokedex.

Get found pokemon creates new pokedex with previous poke and next 
pokedex pointers and add pokemon to the lists if found.

Get found pokemon creates new pokedex with previous poke and next 
pokedex pointers and add pokemon to the lists if found and if pokemon name
contains specified substring.

End search function frees all pokedex except the original pokedex.
