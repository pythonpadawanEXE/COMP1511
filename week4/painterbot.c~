/*For this exercise, make a program called painterbot.c which will scan in 
indices until EOF and then print out a one dimensional array which has 36 '0's, 
except at the given indices it has a '1'.

You can assume that every number you are given will be between 0 and 35. 
You can assume you will never get the same number twice.
